# Walmarts

This code generates the rough maps for [this story](http://www.npr.org/2015/04/01/396757476/the-neighborhood-wal-mart-a-blessing-or-a-curse) which were then finished in Illustrator and published using the [Daily Graphics rig](https://github.com/nprapps/dailygraphics).

This data process was built iteratively as a one-off and the code may not be easy to repurpose. It's here to document our method!

The `scrapers` folder is here for posterity, but isn't being used at all.

## Requirements

* Bash
* PostgreSQL
* PostGIS

## Running it
